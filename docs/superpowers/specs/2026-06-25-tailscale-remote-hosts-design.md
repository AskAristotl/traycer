# Tailscale Remote Hosts — Design

- **Date:** 2026-06-25
- **Status:** Approved (design); pending implementation plan
- **Repo:** `AskAristotl/traycer` (fork of `traycerai/traycer`)
- **Branch:** `feat/tailscale-remote-hosts`

## Context & problem

Traycer's renderer addresses a **host** — the per-machine binary that runs the
coding-agent harnesses — by a `HostDirectoryEntry.websocketUrl`. The transport
(`WsRpcClient` / `WsStreamClient`) is URL-agnostic: it dials whatever URL the
entry carries, and the data model already distinguishes `kind: "local"` from
`kind: "remote"` (`clients/shared/host-client/host-directory.ts`). Remote-host
support was pre-architected but deliberately deferred: `fetchRemoteHosts()` is a
stub returning `[]` (`clients/shared/host-client/remote-fetcher.ts`), and the
`remoteFetcher` is already threaded as a prop into `HostDirectoryService`
(`clients/gui-app/src/providers/host-runtime-provider.tsx:168`).

We want to reach a host running on **another of our own machines** over a
**Tailscale** tailnet. Tailscale (WireGuard) already provides NAT traversal,
transport encryption, device identity, and ACLs — so we do **not** build a
relay server. We supply a real `remoteFetcher`, a host-side bridge that exposes
the host over the tailnet, and a Settings UI to manage remote hosts.

### Hard constraint that shapes the design

The signed host binary **binds to `127.0.0.1`** and self-publishes
`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/rpc` into `~/.traycer/host/pid.json`
(`clients/traycer-cli/src/host/pid-metadata.ts`, `.../store/paths.ts:22`). It is
a closed binary we cannot modify, so we cannot make it bind to the tailnet
interface. A host-side forwarder is therefore **required**, not optional.

## Goals (v1 scope)

- A remote host on the tailnet appears in the host picker with an online/offline
  + version badge.
- A **GUI chat** tab works against the remote host (agent runs).
- A **terminal** tab works against the remote host (PTY).
- **Auto-discovery:** Traycer hosts on the tailnet are enumerated automatically
  (`tailscale status --json` + a `/whoami` probe) and appear in the picker with
  no manual entry.
- A **Settings → Remote Hosts** panel: see discovered hosts + status, toggle
  which to use, and manually add (fallback) or remove a host.
- Hosts use the host's **real `hostId`** (from `/whoami`; see Key Decisions).

## Non-goals (v1)

- No relay/tunnel server (Tailscale is the transport).
- No cross-account authorization work. Multi-person use is served by a **shared
  single account** (see "Accounts & authorization"); separate-account access is
  gated server-side and cannot be enabled from this fork.
- No changes to the closed host binary or the agent-harness integration.
- Inherited remote limitations are accepted and documented, not fixed:
  - OAuth provider re-auth on a remote host routes to the CLI
    (`provider-reauth-banner.tsx`).
  - "Open in editor" is local-filesystem-only.
  - A terminal tab dies if its remote host goes offline (bound-for-life,
    `AGENTS.md:80-90`).

## Key decisions

1. **Use the host's real `hostId`, fetched from the bridge's `/whoami`, not a
   synthetic id.** A machine can be *local* to you when you sit at it and
   *remote* when you don't. Tabs/artifacts persist `hostId` and are cloud-synced;
   a synthetic id would diverge from the same machine's local id and break
   clone-not-migrate and tab binding (`AGENTS.md:71-90`). The bridge reads the
   canonical id from `pid.json`.

2. **One MagicDNS HTTPS frontend (`tailscale serve`, port 443) — no custom
   ports.** Tailscale HTTPS issues a publicly-valid cert for
   `<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net`. The renderer dials `wss://<host>/rpc` and fetches
   `https://<host>/whoami`, both already permitted by the desktop CSP
   (`https:` / `wss:` in `content-security-policy.ts:30`) — **no CSP change, no
   port bookkeeping**. A host is added by its tailnet name alone.
   - *Fallback (not v1 default):* plaintext `tailscale serve --tcp` on a fixed
     port + probing from the Electron main process.

3. **Probe from the Electron main process, not the renderer.** Mirrors existing
   reachability code (`canReachHostWebsocketUrl`, host-readiness), avoids any CSP
   nuance, and works for the plaintext fallback. The actual `wss://` RPC/stream
   connection still runs in the renderer via the existing transport (Tailscale
   certs are publicly trusted).

4. **All participants share ONE Traycer account (shared-account model).** See
   "Accounts & authorization" below. The client's bearer is threaded into the WS
   open-frame and validated by the *remote* host (`ws-rpc-client.ts:184`); the
   host then applies **server-side team-backed role checks**
   (`request-context.ts:194-199`). A single shared account makes every
   client/host the same `userId` (owner role, full `canAct`), which is the only
   topology this fork can guarantee — cross-account authorization is enforced in
   the closed host/cloud and is out of our control.

## Accounts & authorization (multi-person)

Target use: three people (you, a colleague, a shared Mac Studio), each able to
reach the others' hosts. The **network** layer (Tailscale) handles N machines
trivially. The **authorization** layer does not, and it is decided server-side:

- The host verifies the bearer JWT, then runs **team-backed role checks**
  (`request-context.ts:194-199`); access is an org/team/role property
  (`role: "owner"|"viewer"`, `canAct` — `subscribe.ts:274-276`), and the host is
  "single-user today" (`provider-schemas.ts:103`). Enforcement is in the closed
  host + cloud, **not in this repo**.

Options, in order of certainty:

1. **Shared single account (chosen for v1).** All three sign into the *same*
   Traycer account on their devices. Every bearer/host is one `userId` → owner +
   `canAct`. The Tailscale design works unchanged; topology is just three
   machines each running the bridge, each addable as a remote host. Caveats: no
   per-person attribution; the "single-user today" host may show concurrency
   rough edges under simultaneous use; provider (Claude/Codex) auth stays
   per-machine regardless; sharing a seat is a Traycer-ToS gray area.
2. **Same Traycer Team/org (possible upgrade, unverified).** Preserves
   identities, but a connecting teammate may resolve to `viewer`/limited
   `canAct`, and host-connection behavior is server-enforced and not verifiable
   from this repo. May require a paid Team plan.
3. **Three independent accounts (not viable).** Tokens authenticate but have no
   shared role → server-side authz denies cross-host access.

## Components (five bounded units)

### 1. Host-side bridge — new `traycer` CLI subcommand
- **Location:** `clients/traycer-cli/src/` (new `tailnet-bridge` runtime module +
  commands).
- **Behavior:** reads `~/.traycer/host/pid.json` (reuse `readHostPidMetadata`);
  runs a tiny local HTTP server for `/whoami` (returns `hostId`, `version`) and
  `/healthz`; drives `tailscale serve` HTTPS path-routing so
  `/whoami`,`/healthz` → bridge and `/rpc`,`/stream` → host ws port; watches
  `pid.json` and reconfigures `serve` on host respawn (new port).
- **Install/uninstall** as launchd/systemd service by mirroring the existing
  `service-install.ts` / `service-status.ts` / `service-uninstall.ts`.
- **Depends on:** the `tailscale` CLI and `pid.json`. **Interface:** tailnet
  HTTPS endpoints. **Testable** with a fake `tailscale` exec + temp `pid.json`.

### 2. Remote-host config store — renderer
- **Location:** `clients/gui-app/src/stores/remote-hosts/`.
- Persisted Zustand store (`basePersistOptions` + new `STORE_KEYS` entry) holding
  manually-added hosts `{ tailnetName, label, hostId, addedAt }[]` plus a
  per-`hostId` enable/disable map for discovered hosts (so a user can hide one).
  Pure state, no I/O.

### 3. Electron-main Tailscale probe + enumeration + IPC — new
- **Location:** `clients/desktop/src/electron-main/host/remote-probe.ts`.
- `probeRemoteHost(tailnetName) → { reachable, hostId, version }` via Node
  `https GET /whoami|/healthz`.
- `enumerateTailnetHosts() → { tailnetName, hostId, version }[]`: run
  `tailscale status --json`, take each online peer's `DNSName`, probe its
  `/whoami`, and keep the ones that answer (a running Traycer bridge). Peers that
  don't answer are silently skipped.
- Both exposed over the existing `runner-ipc.ts` bridge.

### 4. Real `remoteFetcher` — renderer
- **Location:** `clients/gui-app/src/lib/host/tailnet-remote-fetcher.ts`.
- Composes **enumerated** hosts (unit 3 `enumerateTailnetHosts`) with
  **manually-added** hosts (unit 2), de-dupes by `hostId` (a discovered host also
  added manually appears once), drops user-disabled discovered hosts, and returns
  `HostDirectoryEntry[]` (`kind:"remote"`, `websocketUrl:"wss://<name>/rpc"`,
  `status`, `version`).
- **Wire-in:** replace the `null`/stub `remoteFetcher` at the desktop mount that
  feeds `host-runtime-provider.tsx:168`. Downstream (picker, binding, transport)
  is unchanged.

### 5. Settings → Remote Hosts panel — renderer
- **Location:**
  `clients/gui-app/src/components/settings/panels/remote-hosts-settings-panel.tsx`.
- Lists **discovered** hosts (from unit 3) with online/offline + version badges
  and an enable/disable toggle; plus a **manual add** fallback (enter a tailnet
  name, probe `/whoami` to capture the canonical `hostId`) and remove. Registered
  in the settings nav beside Providers/Host; mirrors `providers-settings-panel.tsx`.

## Data flow

1. **Discover:** on start / periodically, main runs `tailscale status --json`,
   probes each online peer's `/whoami`, and returns the running Traycer hosts.
2. **Manual add (fallback):** user enters a tailnet name → main probes `/whoami`
   → real `hostId` + version captured → saved to store.
3. **Refresh:** `remoteFetcher` merges discovered + saved (de-duped by `hostId`,
   user-disabled hosts dropped), re-probes `/healthz` → entries with `status`.
4. **Merge:** `HostDirectoryService` merges local + remote → picker shows the
   remote host with its badge.
5. **Connect:** select remote host → existing `bind()` → `WsRpcClient` dials
   `wss://<name>/rpc` → remote host validates bearer (same account) → chat +
   terminal work.
6. **Respawn:** host restarts on a new port → bridge reconfigures `tailscale
   serve` → `wss://<name>/rpc` keeps resolving (stable external surface).

## Error handling

- **Bridge:** `tailscale` missing / logged-out / `serve` failure → explicit CLI
  error + service logs; `pid.json` absent (host down) → retry/wait.
- **Probe unreachable:** entry stays in the list but flips to
  `status:"unavailable"` (offline badge) — never silently dropped.
- **`hostId` changed on re-probe** (host reinstalled) → surface a "host identity
  changed" warning; user re-confirms.
- **Bearer rejected** (wrong account) → existing `HostRpcError` surfaces with an
  auth hint in the panel.

## Assumptions & constraints

- All participants/devices are logged into **one shared Traycer account** (see
  "Accounts & authorization"). Separate-account access is out of scope.
- **Tailscale HTTPS / MagicDNS certs are enabled** on the tailnet (one-time
  admin-console toggle).
- The signed host binary binds `127.0.0.1` and is not modifiable.
- The fork tracks the upstream protocol; version negotiation is per-method, so
  modest client/host version skew degrades gracefully.

## Risks & de-risking

- **`tailscale serve` path-routing + WebSocket-upgrade proxying** is the
  load-bearing external assumption. **De-risk first:** validate a throwaway
  `serve` config that routes `/whoami` to a local HTTP server and `/rpc` to a
  local WS server, and confirm a `wss://` client round-trips, *before* building
  units on it.
- Tailscale HTTPS cert provisioning latency on first `serve` — acceptable;
  one-time per host.
- `tailscale status --json` output shape: read only the stable `Peer[].DNSName`
  / `Peer[].Online` fields and guard parsing; unreadable output degrades to
  "no discovered hosts" (manual add still works).

## Testing strategy

- **Bridge runtime:** unit test with a fake `tailscale` exec + temp `pid.json`
  (assert serve args; reconfigure on pid change).
- **`remoteFetcher`:** unit test composing store + mocked probe + mocked
  enumeration → asserts entry shape/status and discovered-vs-manual de-dupe by
  `hostId` (extends existing `host-directory-service.test.ts`).
- **Main probe + enumeration:** unit test with a mocked `tailscale status --json`
  payload + mock `/whoami` server (assert online peers parsed, non-bridge peers
  skipped).
- **Settings panel:** component tests mirroring `providers-settings-panel.test.tsx`.
- **Acceptance (manual, two machines):** add host → open a GUI chat *and* a
  terminal tab against it.

## Acceptance criteria

1. From machine A, add machine B by its tailnet name; the panel shows B online
   with its version, using B's real `hostId`.
2. B appears in the host picker; selecting it binds without error.
3. A GUI chat on B runs an agent end-to-end.
4. A terminal tab on B attaches to a working PTY.
5. Restarting B's host (new port) does not break an existing `wss://B/rpc`
   binding after the bridge reconfigures.
6. A machine running the bridge appears in another machine's picker **without
   any manual entry** (auto-discovery); disabling it in Settings hides it.

## Out of scope / future

- Cross-account host sharing + in-app per-host ACL UX. (Network-level
  who-reaches-whom is handled by **Tailscale ACLs** — a tailnet config we
  recommend, not app code.)
- Remote-aware fixes for OAuth re-auth and "open in editor".
- Plaintext `--tcp` fallback path (documented but not the v1 default).
